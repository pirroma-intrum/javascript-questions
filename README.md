# Intrum Javascript Interview Questions 2023

Welcome to our guide on internal JavaScript interview questions for external providers in the year 2023! As a leading provider of credit management and debt collection services, Intrum is committed to maintaining the highest standards of code quality and best practices. As part of our efforts to ensure that our external providers meet these standards, we have developed this guide to help us verify their compliance during the interview process. In this guide, we'll be covering a range of JavaScript-related topics that are relevant to best practices and code quality standards. From fundamental concepts like data types and variables to more advanced topics like asynchronous programming and object-oriented design, this guide will help us assess your knowledge and skills as a developer.

## How to use this guide?

Go to the questions [file](https://github.com/pirroma-intrum/javascript-questions/blob/master/Javascript-Tricky-EN.md) to read and learn about each answer developers from a external provider must give you.

Here's an example:

Question:
```bash
What is typeof []
```

Answer:
```bash
Object. Actually Array is derived from Object. If you want to check array use Array.isArray(arr)
```
